This assignment provided valuable hands-on experience across multiple domains of Python programming relevant to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence. By completing these exercises, I gained a deeper understanding of input validation, error handling, structured data processing, numerical computation using NumPy, and working with external APIs.

The tasks helped bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and real-world application, reinforcing the importance of writing modular, well-documented, and efficient code. Overall, this assignment enhanced my confidence in using Python for data processing and analysis tasks and prepared me to tackle more complex challenges in my journey as a Data Science professional.
