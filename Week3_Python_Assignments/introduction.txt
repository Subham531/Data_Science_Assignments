In today’s data-driven world, Python has become a fundamental tool for Data Science and Artificial Intelligence applications. This assignment was designed to strengthen core Python programming skills while applying them to real-world problem scenarios commonly encountered in the industry.

Through this assignment, I worked on tasks involving date and time manipulation, mathematical logic, file handling, structured data processing using NumPy, and real-time data extraction through APIs. Each exercise focuses on writing clean, readable, and error-resilient code while following best programming practices.

The objective of this assignment is not only to demonstrate technical proficiency in Python but also to showcase problem-solving ability, logical thinking, and practical implementation skills required for a Data Science / AI role.
